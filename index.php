We give cash rewards to our best two (2) users, this happens once weekly. The user with the best score is given #7,000 and the runner-up is gifted #3,000. The idea behind this is to create financial incentives that will encourage people to get back to the reading culture.

On Book Champ, there are two (2) modes of learning users can choose from - the free and the paid. Our educational contents are free for users but our quiz platform is not. Users will be required to buy a subscription plan to gain access to our quiz section. Subscription plans start from as little as #100.</p>

One of the objectives of Book Champ is preparing the youths for Leadership; we believe that ‘Great Leaders are great readers.’ Meaningful change must begin from the mind, hence, we shall create highly engaging contents that would raise the overall productivity of the youths. Also, content that majors in Leadership shall be incorporated into the platform with time. As the platform grows, we shall create content for other age brackets too.

When we talk about ‘Leadership,’ we are not just referring to Political leadership. We believe that leadership begins from the basic unit of every society – the family. Leadership is a fundamental human need and everyone born into this world is a potential leader. Book Champ seeks to raise the next generation of leaders in various industries and human endeavours.

Book Champ will experience a progressive form of remodeling as we work towards becoming the world’s biggest educational hub.
